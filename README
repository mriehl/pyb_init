What it does
============

When using the `pybuilder <http://pybuilder.github.com>`_, every project
needs to be initialized. After checking out the project, you need to

-  Create a virtual environment.
-  Activate the virtual environment.
-  Install the pybuilder in the virtual environment.
-  Install the project dependencies in the virtual environment.
-  Run pyb to build and test your project.

This program is an attempt at making these routine operations dead
simple and time-efficient. Note that virtual environments are always
created with the --clear flag, meaning you can run pyb-init to *reset*
your virtual environment, for example after changing a dependency.

::

    sudo pip install pyb-init
